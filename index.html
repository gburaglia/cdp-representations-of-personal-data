      </p>
      <p>In corporate settings, call logs can help measure customer service performance or assess telecommunication call
        service. In personal settings, call logs can serve as evidence in criminal investigations. Both scenarios likely
        analyze volume, frequency, and call duration metrics. However, the average personal user does not typically
        analyze their call history information.

      </p>
      <p>I exported my call logs from my cellphone provider and manually combined them with my internet calls through
        WhatsApp and Facetime for the past 16 days. I then cleaned the dataset to exclude spam and non-personal calls.
        During my process, I ranked who I spoke to the most and grouped people to recognize social circle patterns.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>
        Even though the ranking was telling, as Data Feminism teaches, considering context highlights hidden patterns
        and motivations. These numbers don’t show that I currently live in Atlanta with my boyfriend, Gustavo, I see him
        daily,
        and our conversations mainly occur in person. I’m also slowly building a social circle in Atlanta, but many of
        the people I speak to here, I talk to in person and are not represented in my call log history dataset. These
        hidden patterns are addressed by incorporating a timeline that contextualizes my relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the highest-ranked relationship on my call logs is my father, Bernardo. However, what is not
        evident is the emotional turmoil he has been experiencing in the last few weeks. I have recently had
        uncharacteristically long calls trying to talk him out of negative thought spirals and reassure him that he has
        countless blessings. This could have been accounted for by additionally recording and visualizing conversation
        topics.

      </p>
      <p>The unconventional format I explored was a network, where I visualized a dataset of the relationships in my
        life, contextualized by my call log history dataset. Each node is someone I talked to on the phone in the past
        16 days, the size is the total number of minutes, the colors are what social circles they belong to, and the
        links are the relationships between these people.</p>
      <p>

        I received a critique from classmates on the first iteration. The three most common comments were a desire for
        more context around when/how I met the people in my network diagram, call frequency, and where I fit into all
        the relationships.

      <h2 class="display-5">Final Representation
      </h2>
      <p>My final design addresses the three main critique points and involves a third dataset to add the context of
        when/where I made these relationships. I also refined the links to only show independent relationships and not
        acquaintances mediated through me, and I added extra pop-up information such as total minutes and call
        frequency.
